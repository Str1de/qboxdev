# Strawberry Gardens Legion Square - V2

An improved and reworked Strawberry Gardens Legion rework by [FalseHopeDesigns](https://falsehopedesigns.tebex.io/) that fixes gaps, prop placement, lights, and all other map issues in the [original release](https://forum.cfx.re/t/strawberry-gardens-free-legion-square-replaced). Includes working navmesh for proper ped movement throughout the map.

**Warning:** Legion Square is a highly popular and central area of the GTA 5 map. While we have done our best to make this compatible with other maps, you may experience conflicts. 

If your map is escrowed or purchased from a creator, please get in touch with the original creator for assistance with compatibility.

### **We will not provide compatibility or support.**

If you have any other resources with a sp_manifest.ymt file it MUST be combined with the included sp_manifest.ymt file. Running two separate sp_manifest.ymt files **WILL** break scenarios (most obviously animal spawns) around the game map. A corrupted sp_manifest.ymt file **WILL** either just crash your game or completely break scenarios and animal spawns around the map.

Before reporting any issues regarding scenarios, double, triple, and quadruple-check your map files for sp_manifest.ymt files or other conflicting scenario *.ymt files. All issues opened regarding scenarios or the sp_manifest file without detailed information will be closed. The same applies for any other general mapping files which may conflict with surrounding mlos (Most notably Pillbox hospitals, Fleeca banks and MRPD mlos.)
