When ReserveGraceSlot = true:
    The server will reserve a slot for a grace player until:
        -The grace player rejoins, or
        -The grace timer expires.
    This means the server will have one less slot available for normal players. For example:
    If the server has 100 slots, and 1 slot is reserved for a grace player, only 99 slots will be available for normal players.
    If the server is full (99/100), new players will be placed in a queue.

When ReserveGraceSlot = false:
    If the server has 100 slots and is already full (100/100), the grace player can still join, resulting in 101/100 players for a sort time.
